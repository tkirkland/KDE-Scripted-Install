## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs before processing
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with recovery options
- **Logging**: Maintain detailed logs for debugging and audit purposes
- **Security**: Follow security best practices, avoid exposing sensitive information
- **Modularity**: Maintain clean separation between components
- **Documentation**: Document all functions with clear parameter and return specifications

### Testing Requirements

- **Dry-Run Testing**: Always test with simulation mode before live execution
- **Configuration Validation**: Test with corrupted and incomplete configuration files
- **Network Configuration**: Test all network configuration types (DHCP, static, manual)
- **Drive Selection**: Test drive selection with multiple drives and Windows detection
- **Error Scenarios**: Test error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Architecture Patterns

The project follows these architectural patterns:

**Model-View-Controller (MVC)**:
- **Model**: Configuration data, system state, installation progress
- **View**: User interface (CLI currently, GUI-ready architecture)
- **Controller**: Business logic, installation orchestration, user interaction handling

**Observer Pattern**:
- Configuration changes trigger dependent updates
- Installation progress updates notify multiple observers
- Error conditions broadcast to error handlers

**Command Pattern**:
- All system operations wrapped in command objects
- Dry-run mode implementation through command abstraction
- Undo/recovery operations for failed commands

**Strategy Pattern**:
- Network configuration strategies (DHCP, static, manual)
- Drive detection strategies for different hardware types
- Validation strategies for different configuration types
